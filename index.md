### Project Outline
This project was born of an idea to create a game based on Mario Bros mechanics combined with Spelunky characters.
This game has been develop with P5.js (for graphics), Tone.js (for sound) and Arduino (for hardware).


### Description Of The Project
The developing of this game has been divides into 3 phases:
  - **Phase 1: Building the skeleton of the game with JavaScript.**
  
    In this phase graphics and sound are programmed with P5.js and Tone.js, and game is tested with no hardware (just with the keyboard).
    

  - **Phase 2: Programming in-game mechanics with Arduino + building the hardware**.

    Now the game mechanics are programmed with Arduino, so the game can be played with a hardware "device".
    
    
  - **Phase 3: Combining both Arduino and JavaScript to make the game work as wanted.**

    In this final phase, the game is tested implementing all the codes and hardware at the same time. Final adjustements were made here to make the perfect final version.

### Future Development

*Block Skip!* has a lot to improve for the future!. Plenty of things could still be developed: new characters, air blocks, air platforms, extra objects (like coins, power-ups, enemies, etc.), multiplayer mode and so on!. As the game gets more complex, more resources will be required, like more hardware pieces, extra code scripts, new media files... But that's what a good game needs!. Hope *Block Skip!* can be fully developed one day and be released worldwide.
